1. CHAP. I.

    _ Vers. I. The words of the Preacher, the Son of David, King of Jerusalem.

    _ Vers. II. Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; Vanity of vanities; all is vanity.

    _ Vers. III. What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the Sun?

    _ Vers. IV. One generation passeth away, and another generation commeth: but the earth abideth for ever.

    _ Vers. V. The Sun also ariseth, and the Sun goeth down, and hasteth to (or panteth aster) his place, where he arose.

    _ Vers. VI. The Wind goeth towards the South, and turneth about unto the North; it whirleth about continually; and the wind returneth again, according to his circuits.

    _ Vers. VII. All the rivers run into the Sea; yet the Sea is not full: unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.

    _ Vers. VIII. All things are full of labour, man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.

    _ Vers. IX. The thing that hath been, is that which shall be: and that which is done, is that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the Sun.

    _ Vers. X. Is there any thing, whereof it may be said, see, this is new? it hath bin already of Old time, which was before us.

    _ Vers. IX. There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall their be any remembrance of things that are to come, with those that shall come after.

    _ Vers. XII. I the Preacher was King over Israel, in Jerusalem.

    _ Vers. XIII. And I gave my heart to seek and search out by Wisdom, concerning all things that are done under Heaven: This sore travel hath God given to the Sons of Man, to be exercised therewith.

    _ Vers. 14. I have seen all the works that are done under the Sun; and behold, all is vanity, and vexation of spirit.

    _ Vers. 15. That which is crooked, cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting, cannot be numbred.

    _ Vers. XVI. I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom then all they that have bin before me, in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience (Heb. seen much) of wisdom and knowledg.

    _ Vers. XVII. And I gave my heart to know Wisdom, and to know Madness and Folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.

    _ Vers. XVIII. For, in much wisdom is much grief: and he that encreaseth knowledg, increaseth sorrow.

1. CHAP. II.

    _ Vers. I. I said in my heart, go to now; I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and behold, this also is Vanity.

    _ Vers. II. I said of Laughter, it is mad: and of Mirth, what doth it?

    _ Vers. III. I sought in mine heart, to give my self unto wine (yet acquainting my heart with Wisdom) and to lay hold on Folly, till I might see what was that good for the Sons of men, which they should do under the Heaven, all the dayes of their life.

    _ Vers. XI. Then I looked on all the workes that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit; and there was no profit under the Sun.

    _ Vers. XII. And I turned my self to behold wisdom, and madness and folly: for, what can the man do, that cometh after the King? even that which hath been already done.

    _ Vers. XIII. Then I saw, that Wisdom excelleth Folly, as far as Light excelleth Darkness.

    _ Vers. XIIII. The wise Man's Eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I my self perceived also, that one event happeneth to them all.

    _ Vers. XV. Then said I in my heart, as it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.

    _ Vers. XVI. For there is no remembrance of the wise, more then of the fool, for ever; seeing that which now is, in the days to come, shall all be forgotten; and how dieth the Wise Man? as the Fool.

    _ Vers. XVII. Therefore I hated life, because the Work that is wrought, under the sun, is grievous unto me: for, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.

    _ Vers. XVIII. Yea, I hated all my labour, which I had taken under the Sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.

    _ Vers. XIX. And, who knoweth whether he shall be a wise Man, or a fool? Yet shall he have Rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shew'd my self wise, under the Sun. This is also vanity.

    _ Vers. XX. Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the Labour which I took under the Sun.

    _ Vers. XXI. For, there is a man, whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity: Yet, to a man that hath not laboured therein, shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity, and a great Evil.

    _ Vers. XXII. For, what hath a Man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the Sun?

    _ Vers. XXIII. For, all his dayes are sorrows; and his Travel, grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.

    _ Vers. XXIIII. There is nothing better for a man, then that he should Eat and Drink; and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.

    _ Vers. XXV. For, who can eat? or who else can hasten hereunto, more then I?

    _ Vers. XXVI. For, God giveth to a man that is good in his sight, Wisdom, and Knowledg, and Joy: But, to the sinner he giveth Travel, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

1. CHAP. III.

    _ Vers. I. To every thing there is a Season, and a time to every Purpose under the Heaven.

    _ Vers. 2. A time to be Born, and a time to Die: A time to Plant, and a time to pluck up that which is Planted.

    _ Vers, 5. A time to cast away Stones, and a time to gather Stones together: a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing.

    _ Vers. 6. A time to Get and a time to Lose: A time to Keep, and a time to cast Away.

    _ Vers. 7. A time to Rent, and a time to Sew: A time to keep Silence and a time to Speak.

    _ Vers. VIII. A time to Love, and a time to Hate: a time of War, and a time of Peace.

    _ Vers. IX. What profit hath he that worketh, in that wherein he laboureth?

    _ Vers. X. I have seen the travel which God hath given to the Sons of Men, to be exercised in it; Heb. To afflict or humble them thereby.

    _ Vers. XI. He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the World in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh, from the beginning to the end.

    _ Vers. XII. I know that there is no good in them, but for a Man to rejoyce, and to do good in his life.

    _ Vers. 13. And also, that every Man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his Labour, it is the gift of God.

    _ Vers. XIV. I know that whatsoever God doth, it shall be for ever: Nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: And God doth it, that Men should fear before him.

    _ Vers. XV. That which hath been, is now; and that which is to be, hath already been; and God requireth that which is past;

    _ Vers. XVI. And moreover, I saw under the Sun, the place of Judgment, that Wickedness was there; and the place of Righteousness, that Iniquity was there.

    _ Vers. XVII. I said in mine Heart, God shall Judg the Righteous and the Wicked: For, there is a time there, for every purpose, and for every work.

    _ Vers. XVIII. I said in my Heart, concerning the Estate of the Sons of Men, that God might Manifest them, and that they might see that they themselvs are Beasts.

    _ Vers. XIX. For, that which befalleth the Sons of Men, befalleth Beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a Man hath no pre-eminence above a Beast: for, all is vanity.

    _ Vers. XX. All go unto one place: All are of the Dust, and all turn to Dust again.

    _ Vers. XXI. Who knoweth the Spirit of Man that goeth upward, and the Spirit of the Beast that goeth downward to the Earth? Or,

    _ Vers. XXII. Wherefore, I perceive, that there is nothing better, then that a Man should rejoyce in his own works; for that is his Portion: for, who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?

1. CHAP. IV.

    _ Vers. I. So I returned, and considered all the Oppressions that are done under the Sun. And behold, the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no Comforter: And on the side of their Oppressors, there was power; but, they had no Comforter.

    _ Vers. II. Wherefore I praised the Dead which are already Dead, more than the living which are yet alive.

    _ Vers. III. Yea, better is he then both they, which hath not yet bin; who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the Sun.

    _ Vers. IV. Again, I consider'd all travel, and every right work; that for this a Man is envied of his Neighbour: This is also vanity, and vexation of spirit.

    _ Vers. V. The Fool foldeth his Hands together, and Eateth his own Flesh.

    _ Vers. VI. Better is a handful with quietness, than both the hands full, with travel and Vexation of spirit.

    _ Vers. VII. Then I returned, and I saw Vanity under the Sun.

    _ Vers. VIII. There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither Child nor Brother: Yet is there no end of all his Labour, neither is his Eye satisfied with Riches; neither saith he, For whom do I Labour and Bereave my Soul of good? This is also Vanity; yea, it is a sore Travel.

    _ Vers. IX. Two are better then one; because they have a good reward for their Labour.

    _ Vers. X. For if they fall, the one will lift up his Fellow; but Wo to him that is alone, when he falleth: For he hath not another to help him up.

    _ Vers. XI. Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but, how can one be warm alone?

    _ Vers. XII. And, if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a three-fold Cord is not quickly broken.

    _ Vers. XIII. Better is a poor and a wise Child, than an Old and foolish King, who will no more be admonished (Heb. knoweth not to be admonished.

    _ Vers. XIV. For, out of Prison he cometh to Reign (Heb. Out of the House of Bond-Men, or Bondage, he goes forth to Reign) Whereas also, he that is Born in his Kingdom, becometh. Poor.

    _ Vers. XV. I considered all the living which walk under the Sun, with the second Child that shall stand up in his stead.

    _ Vers. XVI. There is no end of all the People, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after, shall not rejoyce in him: surely this also is vanity, and vexation of Spirit.

1. CHAP. V.

    _ Vers. I. Keep thy Foot, when thou goest to the House of God; and be more ready to hear, then to give the Sacrifice of Fools: For, they consider not that they do evil.

    _ V. II. Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for, God is in heaven; and thou, upon earth: therefore, let thy words be few.

    _ Vers. III. For, a Dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by a multitude of words.

    _ Vers. IV. When thou vowest a Vow unto God, deferr not to pay it: For, he hath no pleasure in Fools; pay that which thou hast vowed.

    _ Vers. V. Better is it, that thou should'st not vow, then that thou should'st vow, and not pay.

    _ Vers. 6. Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to Sin; neither say thou before the Angel (70. before God) that it was an errour: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?

    _ Vers. VII. For, in the multitude of Dreams, and many Words, there are also divers Vanities: but, fear thou God.

    _ Vers. 8. If thou seest the Oppression of the Poor, and violent perverting of Judgment and Justice in a Province, marvel not at the matter (Heb. will or purpose) for he that is higher then the highest, regardeth; and there be higher than they.

    _ Vers. IX. Moreover, the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field.

    _ Vers. X. He that loveth silver, shall not be satisfied with silver: nor he that loveth abundance, with encrease: this is also vanity.

    _ Verse. XI. When goods encrease, they are increas'd that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes.

    _ Vers. XII. The sleep of a labouring Man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance (Arab. covetousness) of the Rich, will not suffer him to sleep.

    _ Vers. XIII. There is a sore Evil, which I have seen under the Sun; namely, Riches kept for the Owners thereof, to their hurt.

    _ Vers. XIV. But, those riches perish by evil travel (Heb. in the evil use (or employment) of them) and, he begetteth a Son, and there is nothing in his hand.

    _ Vers. XV. As he came forth of his Mothers Womb, naked shall he return, to go as he came; and, shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.

    _ Vers. XVI. And, this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the Wind?

    _ Vers. XVII. All his days also he eateth in darkness; and he hath much sorrow, and wrath with his sickness.

    _ Vers. XVIII. Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comly for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour, that he taketh vnder the Sun, all the days of his Life, which God giveth him: for, it is his portion.

    _ Vers. XIX. Every man also, to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his Portion, and to rejoyce in his labour; This is the Gift of God.

    _ Vers. XX. For, he shall not much remember the days of his Life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.

1. CHAP. VI.

    _ Vers. I. There is an evil which I have seen under the Sun, and it is common among Men: (Hebr. much upon man) What?

    _ Vers. 3. If a Man beget an hundred Children, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also that he have no burial, I say, that an untimely birth is better than he.

    _ Vers. 4. For he cometh in with Vanity, and departeth in darkness; and, his name shall be covered with darkness.

    _ Vers. 5. Moreover, he hath not seen the Sun, nor known any thing: this hath more rest than the other.

    _ Vers. 6. Yea, though he live a thousand years, twice told; yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place?

    _ Vers. 7. All the labour of Man is for his mouth: and yet the appetite (Heb. Soul) is not fill'd.

    _ Ver. 8. For, what hath the Wise more than the Fool? What hath the Poor, that knoweth to walk before the Living?

    _ Vers. 9. Better is the sight of the Eyes, than the wandring of the desire, (Heb walking of the Soul) this is also vanity, and vexation of Spirit.

    _ Ver. 10. That which hath bin, is named already; and it is known, that it is Man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.

    _ Vers. 11. Seeing there be many things that encrease vanity, what is Man the better?

    _ Vers. 12. For, who knoweth what is good for Man, in this life, all the days of his vain life, which he spendeth as a shadow? For, who can tell a Man, what shall be after him, under the Sun?

1. CHAP. VII.

    _ V. 1. A good Name is better then precious Ointment: and the day of death, then the day of one's birth.

    _ Vers. 2. It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for, that is the end of all Men, and the living will lay it to his heart.

    _ Vers. 3. Sorrow is better then laughter: for, by the sadness of the Countenance, the heart is made better.

    _ Vers. 4. The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but, the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.

    _ Vers. 5. It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a Man to hear the song of fools.

    _ Vers. 6. For, as the crackling (Voice or Sound) of thorns under a pa, so is the laughter of the Fool: this also is Vanity.

    _ Vers. 7. Surely, oppression maketh a wise Man, mad; and, a gift destroyeth the heart.

    _ Ver. 9. Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.

    _ Vers. 10. Say not thou, what is the cause that the former days were better then these? for thou dost not enquire wisely, concerning this.

    _ Vers. 11. Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the Sun.

    _ Vers. 12. For, Wisdom is a defence (Heb. shadow) and mony is a desence; but, the excellency of knowledg, is, that Wisdom giveth life to them that have it.

    _ Vers. 13. Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?

    _ Vers. 14. In the day of Prosperity, be joyful; but, in the day of Adversity, consider: God also, hath set the one over against the other, to the end that Man should find nothing after him.

    _ Vers. 15. All things have I seen in the days of my Vanity: there is a just Man, that perisheth in his Righteousness; and, there is a wicked Man, that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.

    _ Vers. 16. Be not righteous over-much, neither make thy-self over-wise: why shouldst thou destroy thy felf? (Heb. be desolate?)

    _ Vers. 17. Be not over-much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldst thou die before thy time? (Heb. not in thy time?)

    _ Vers. 18. It is good that thou should'st take hold of this; yea also, from this withdraw not thine hand: for, he that feareth God, shall come forth of them all.

    _ Vers. 19. Wisdom strength'neth the wise, more then ten mighty Men which are in the City.

    _ Vers. 20. For, there is not a just man upon earth, that doth good, and sinneth not.

    _ Vers. 21. Also, take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy Servant curse thee.

    _ Vers. 22. For often-times also, thine own heart knoweth, that thou thy self likewise hast cursed others.

    _ Vers. 23. All this have I proved by Wisdom: I said I will be wise; but, it was far from me.

    _ Vers. 24. That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?

    _ Vers. 25. I applied mine heart, to know, and to search, and to seek out Wisdom, and the reason of things; and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness.

    _ Vers. 26. And I find more bitter then death, the Woman whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God (Heb. is good before God) shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.

    _ Vers. 27. Behold, this have I found (saith the Preacher) counting one by one, to find out the account,

    _ Vers. 28. Which yet my Soul seeketh, but I find not: one Man, among a thousand, have I found; but, a Woman among all those, have I not found.

    _ Ver. 29. Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made Man upright; but, they have sought out many Inventions.

1. CHAP. VIII.

    _ V. 1. Who is as the wise Man? and, who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? (Heb. word) A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness (Heb. strength) of his face shall be changed.

    _ Vers. 2. I counsel thee to keep the King's Commandment; and that, in regard of the Oath of God.

    _ Vers. 3. Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for, he doth whatsoever pleaseth him.

    _ Vers. 4. Where the word of a King is, there is power: and who may say unto him, what dost thou?

    _ Vers. 5. Whoso keepeth the Commandment, shall feel no evil thing: and, a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.

    _ Vers. 6. Because to every purpose, there is time and judgment; therefore the misery of man is great upon him.

    _ Vers. 7. For, he knoweth not that which shall be: for, who can tell him, when (or how) it shall be?

    _ Vers. 8. There is no Man hath Power over the Spirit, to retain the Spirit; neither hath he Power in the day of Death: and, there is no discharge in that War; neither shall Wickedness deliver those that are given to it.

    _ Ver. 9. All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the Sun: there is a time, wherein one man ruleth over another, to his own hurt.

    _ Vers. 10. And so, I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy; and they were forgotten in the City where they had so done: this is also Vanity.

    _ Ver. 11. Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily; therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.

    _ Ver. 12. Tho' a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged; yet surely, I know that it shall be well with them thatf ear God, which fear before him.

    _ Vers. 13. But, it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days which are as a shadow, because he feareth not before God.

    _ Vers. 14. There is a Vanity which is done upon the Earth, that there be just Men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the Wicked: again, there be wicked Men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the Righteous: I said, that this also is Vanity.

    _ Vers. 15. Then I commended Mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the Sun, then to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for, that shall abide with him of his labour, the days of his life, which God giveth him under the Sun.

    _ Vers. 16. When I applied mine Heart to know Wisdom, and to see the business, that is done upon the Earth: (for also there is that neither Day nor Night seeth sleep with his Eyes.)

    _ Vers. 17. Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the Sun: because, tho' a man labour to seek it out; yea, further, tho' a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.

1. CHAP. IX.

    _ V. 1. For all this I consider'd in my Heart, (Heb. gave or set my Heart) even to declare all this; that the Righteous, and the Wise, and their works are in the hand of God: no Man knoweth either Love, or Hatred, by all that is before them.

    _ Vers. 2. All things come alike to all; there is one Event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good, and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an Oath.

    _ Vers. 3. This is an evil among all things that are done under the Sun' that there is one Event unto all: yea, also the heart of the Sons of Men is full of evil, and madness is in their Heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.

    _ Vers. 4. For, to him that is joyned to all the living, there is hope: for, a living Dog is better then a dead Lion.

    _ Ver. 5. For the Living know that they shall die; but the Dead know not any thing; neither have they any more a reward; for, the memory of them is forgotten.

    _ Vers. 6. Also their Love, and their Hatred, and their Envy is now perish'd; neither have they any more a Portion for ever, in any thing that is done under the Sun.

    _ Vers. 7. Go thy way, eat thy Bread with joy, and drink thy Wine with a merry Heart; for, God now accepteth thy Works.

    _ Vers. 8. Let thy Garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.

    _ Vers. 9. Live joyfully with the Wife whom thou lovest, all the days of the life of thy Vanity, which he hath given thee under the Sun, all the days thy Vanity: for, that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the Sun.

    _ Vers. 10. Whatsoever thine Hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for, there is no Work, nor Device, nor Knowledg, nor Wisdom in the Grave whither thou goest.

    _ Vers. 11. I returned, and saw under the Sun, that the Race is not to the swift, nor the Battel to the strong; neither yet Bread to the wise, nor yet Riches to Men of understanding; nor yet favour to Men of skill; but, time and chance happeneth to them all.

    _ Vers. 12. For, Man also knoweth not his time: as the Fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the Birds that are caught in a snare; so are the Sons of Men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.

    _ Vers. 13. This Wisdom have I seen also under the Sun, and it seem'd great unto me.

    _ Vers. 16. Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless, the poor Man's wisdom is despis'd, and his words are not heard.

    _ Vers. 17. The words of wise Men are heard in quiet, more then the cry of him that ruleth among fools.

    _ Vers. 18. Wisdom is better then Weapons of War: but, one sinner destroyeth much good.

1. CHAP. X.

    _ V. 1. Dead Flies (Heb. flies of death) cause the Ointment of the Apothecary, to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little Folly, him that is in reputation for Wisdom and Honour.

    _ Vers. 2. A wise Man's heart is at his right hand; but, a fool's heart, at his left.

    _ Vers. 3. Yea also, when he that is a fool, walketh by the way, his Wisdom (Heb. heart) faileth him; and he saith to every one, that he is a fool.

    _ Vers. 4, If the spirit of the Ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for, yielding pacifieth great offences.

    _ Vers. 5. There is an evil which I have seen under the Sun, as an errour which proceedeth from the ruler.

    _ Vers. 7. I have seen Servants upon Horses, and Princes walking as Servants upon the Earth.
